# ðŸŒŸ Hello! Welcome to my little corner of the internet! ðŸŒŸ

I am a second-year undergraduate at the University of Vermont, with a passion for Computer Science, Mathematics, and Computational Neuroscience. I also like to dip my toes into embedded engineering, server infrastructure, and data science.

## ðŸŒ± About Me

See [my quartz garden](https://ewan.my/)

I have always been someone obsessed with Computer Paradigms through my life, but only about 4 years ago did I really start taking computer science seriously, and I have been borderline obsessed ever since.

Nowadays, I am focusing more on Computational Neuroscience, as I feel that it is the future of real "ai", even if I love the data science of today's machine learning models.

I love to write! I write down everything, following the Zettelkasten method for notetaking but also for just about any idea that happens to be going through my head at any given time.

## Currently Learning

- Dynamical Systems Theory for Brain Modeling
- Predictive Coding Models as an alternative to backpropagation
- Causal Modeling for Density Estimation
