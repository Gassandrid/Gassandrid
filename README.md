# 🌟 Hello! Welcome to my little corner of the internet! 🌟

---

My name is Ewan Pedersen , I am an undergraduate at the University of Vermont studying computer science🎓. My primary interest is in Artificial Intelligence 🤖, but I also have skills in embedded engineering, software development, and cybersecurity.

## 🌱 About Me

I have always been someone obsessed with Computer Paradigms through my life, but only about 4 years ago did I really start taking computer science seriously, and I have been borderline obsessed ever since.

This has manifested in a variety of ways, from working on personal projects to a lot of time invested in obsessive learning.
